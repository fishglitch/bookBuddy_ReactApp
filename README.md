## Branches
This repository contains two primary branches:

### `main`
- **Purpose**: This branch represents the stable production-ready version of the application. Changes that have been thoroughly tested and are ready for deployment are merged into this branch.
- **Usage**: Use this branch if you want to run or deploy the application in a production environment.

### `development`
- **Purpose**: This branch serves as the development branch where new features, bug fixes, and other changes are integrated and tested before they are merged into the `main` branch.
- **Usage**: You can check out this branch to explore the latest features, contribute code, or help with testing.

## How to Switch Branches

To switch between branches, use the following Git commands:

```bash
# To switch to the development branch
git checkout development

# To switch back to the main branch
git checkout main
1. Main branch has clean code
2. console.log branch has console.logs and other notes.
```
## Roadmap of Features
1. 2/20/25: changed path /:id to books/:id
2. TBD: configure search functionality so that the bar does not show up on other path views, if pressed "enter", the search results come up onto another route.
